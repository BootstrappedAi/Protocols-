# Bootstrapped AI Protocols

This repository contains research frameworks and tools for thought. The primary focus is the **Recursive Agent Protocol**, a multi-stage approach for deep research using specialized agents that iterate through decomposition, expansion, and distillation.

[Read the protocol](Recursive%20Agent%20Protocol%20-Deep%20Reasearch%20chain%20of%20Intent.%20.md)

## Usage

1. Open the protocol document and study the stages and agent roles.
2. Adapt the steps to your own projects to structure recursive learning and exploration.

## Contributing
